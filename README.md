Overview
This project implements a Linux kernel module to solve the classic producer-consumer problem using kernel threads and semaphores for synchronization. It calculates the total elapsed time of all processes belonging to a specific user.

NOTE: IMPORTANT 

We want to alert you to the fact that the code we submitted for this project is not complete. We tried our hardest to finish the task, however we ran across serious technical problems that kept us from testing and fully implementing our solution.

There was a critical problem on our laptops that prevented the VM from operating. Despite multiple attempts to reboot and restore the vm, this problem continued. We were therefore unable to launch the kernel and conduct the planned testing of our kernel module.
We also consulted this problem with the TA and they gave us few steps to solve the problem and also they suggested us to submit what ever we have so far.
